    <h1>How Temperature Change Affects Austrlian Foret Fires</h1>

          Forest fires are a major issue in Australia that causes heavy damage
          to the wildlife as well as sometimes impacting the livelihoods of
          Australian citizens. This is an issue that is ongoing and will
          continue to impact Australia until we are able to find ways to prevent
          it completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this map we are able to see that the states in Australia that
          suffer the most forest fires are the northern states which have a more
          tropical climate. The warmer climate causes the forests to be dryer
          and much easier to burn hence being at a much higher risk of forest
          fires starting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forest fires are also very dangerous and have the ability to cause a
          lot of damage. From the cumulative fire damage chart seen below the
          damage that forest fires cause on a yearly basis is millions of
          hectares of forest. Interesting data points to point out is the
          massive spike in damages of forest fires in NSW in 2020 where massive
          bushfires tore through the state, burning through 4.8 million hectares
          of forest. This massive spike in damages is also reflected by the
          number of planned fires within the state, only about 6% of fires that
          year being unplanned. The lack of preparedness and spike in
          temperature the year prior as well as many other factors has led to
          the devastating bushfires that year.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is an ongoing trend that temperatures are rising in Australia.
          The average temperature has had a steady increase since the 1980s and
          the trend has only gone up. This means much warmer temperatures being
          more common which will only increase the risk of bushfires occurring.

            Whilst we tend to associate forest fires as a natural disaster from
            the pie chart we are able to see that in the majority of the states
            actually conduct planned fires. Generally however we are also able
            to see that only about 50% of forest fires in all Australian states
            from 2016-2021 are unplanned natural disasters.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the limited overlapping time of Australian temperature anomaly
            data and the forest fires data we see that there is limited
            correlation. There seems to be a lagged trend where incidents of
            fires occur more frequently the year after a much warmer year. Since
            how forest fires start is more than just the climate we can't draw
            any conclusions however from this comparison, but it does give us an
            understanding of how temperature is able to affect the rates of
            which forest fires occur.
